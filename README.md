# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this exercise was to use SQL for analyzing employee data of an organization and help the organization with succession planning in response to an upcoming "silver sunami". I determined the number of retiring employees per title, and identified employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Results: 
Results of the analysis are as follows:
    1. At PH 72,478 employees are approaching retirement. Number of retiring employees per title can be seen in the table below:

    2. Based on the job titles, 36,291 (50%) retiring employees are engineers.

    3. Based on a provided criteria (current employees who were born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965), 1,549 employees qualify to participate in mentorship program. See table below:

    4. Based on the job title, 748 (48%) employees who are eligible to participate in the mentorship program are engineers.

## Summary: 
As follows is a brief summary of my findings:
 - PH would need to fill 72,478 positions as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact.

 - PH only has 1,549 qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of employees. That would mean each qualified retirement-ready employee would be mentoring 47 new employees. It does not seem to be sustainable solution. My recommendation to PH would be to expand the pool of employees who are eligible to participate in mentorship program by reconsidering the qualification for participation.
